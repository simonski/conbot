# conbot

Welcome to `conbot`!.  Conbot is a utility intended to deal with the rougher corners of data engineering. The more mundane, the better conbot is at it!.  

For example

- file format conversion (especially gzip)
- schema detection
- data generation
- transfer and transform

Conbot is built to perform the "heavy lifting" of common tasks a data engineer may conduct.  

Conbot tries to be simple, small and as fast as possible.  It can be used as terminal tool on a daily basis through to running horizontally in k8s clusters for parallel processing.
